# Factorial-Calculator
This program calculates the factorial of a given number using a simple loop in Python.  A factorial (denoted by n!) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. For example:  5! = 5 √ó 4 √ó 3 √ó 2 √ó 1 = 120  0! = 1

## üìò What is a Factorial?

The **factorial** of a number `n` (written as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers from **1 to n**.

### üî¢ Examples:
- `5! = 5 √ó 4 √ó 3 √ó 2 √ó 1 = 120`
- `3! = 3 √ó 2 √ó 1 = 6`
- `0! = 1` (by definition)
- Factorial is **not defined** for negative numbers.

## üß† How the Program Works

1. The user is asked to input a number.
2. The program checks if the number is:
   - **Negative** ‚Üí shows an error message.
   - **Zero** ‚Üí returns 1.
   - **Positive** ‚Üí uses a loop to calculate the factorial.
3. The result is printed on the screen.
